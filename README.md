Hey there,

I'm @tomtsagk, an indie video game programmer.

I enjoy low level programming, messing with shaders and different OpenGL techniques.
Currently been experimenting with porting C projects to a variety of platforms.

I've also been working on my own programming language called `avdl`.
Check out some games I've made with it:
